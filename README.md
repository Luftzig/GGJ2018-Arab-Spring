# Network Dissidence

A game about resisting censorship using network appliances.

Created as a proof of concept and testing ground for an Elm based game engine.

# Game Enging TODO

We aim at a game engine that will make it as easy to create 2D or 3D games as
creating websites is using Elm. The core challenge is to create great 
abstractions for:

- Rendering Shapes and Sprites
  - Animated Sprites
  - Sliced or composite sprites
- Mouse and Keyboard interaction
  - Other controls interaction
- Declarative framework for animation
- 2D (and maybe 3D) collision detection
- Framework for game objects interactions (AKA physics, but not limited to physics)
- Integrating physics
